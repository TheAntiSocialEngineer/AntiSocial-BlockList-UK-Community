# AntiSocial-BlockList-UK-Community
Get the AntiSocial BlockList, a list of domains that someday might contain phishing

# Usage
Add the raw file link to your prefered blocklisting service. The list is simply domains to block, one per line. This is suitable for PiHoleÂ®, Microsoft Online, Google Workplace, pfsense and many others.

# How Domains Are Added
We scan the internet looking for domain impersonations, we find domains that could be used to trick people and add them to the list. The UK community version focuses on UK services - such as common banks, government departments and high street brands.

# Have We Made A Mistake?
We don't want to police the internet, thats not our intention. If your domain is in the list and you don't think it should be, please raise an issue here and we will check it out. We will not remove new domains that are less than six months old.
