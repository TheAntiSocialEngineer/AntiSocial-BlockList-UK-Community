# DECOMMISSION NOTICE
The AntiSocial Blocklist was officially decommissioned on 30th September 2025.

All supporting servers and dependencies have been shut down, and the project is no longer maintained or updated.

This repository will remain available on GitHub for reference, but it will not receive any further support or servicing.

# AntiSocial-BlockList-UK-Community
Get the AntiSocial BlockList, this is a free, UK centric version of our paid blocklisting service.

# Usage
Add the raw file link to your prefered blocklisting service. The list is simply domains to block, one per line. This is suitable for PiHoleÂ®, Microsoft Online, Google Workplace, pfsense and many others.

# How Domains Are Added
We scan the internet looking for domain impersonations, we find domains that could be used to trick people and add them to the list. The UK community version focuses on UK services - such as common banks, government departments and high street brands.

# Have We Made A Mistake?
We don't want to police the internet, thats not our intention. If your domain is in the list and you don't think it should be, please raise an issue here and we will check it out. We will not remove new domains that are less than six months old.

Please do not raise an issue if you are using the list outside of the UK, as by design it is likely to cause false positives - if you require an alternative list this can be commisioned here: https://theantisocialengineer.com/blocklist/
